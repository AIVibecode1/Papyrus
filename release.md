# Papyrus releases

This file tracks every release of Papyrus: what shipped, what it was built
from, and the exact bullet points for the GitHub release description. It is
written for humans and for AI agents working in this repo.

Rules:

- Every release adds a section below and never deletes or truncates old
  sections: this file is a tracking log, like a quick changelog.
- Each section keeps its version number and the list of what was fixed
  or added in that version.
- The bullet points here are the source of truth for the GitHub release
  description. Copy them as-is.
- The test counts in each section must match the README "Testing and
  quality gates" row at the time of the release.
- Installer artifacts live in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` after a
  build. Attach the MSI and the NSIS setup exe to the GitHub release.

## v1.0.2 - 2026-08-03

Status: installers built, not yet published on GitHub.
Built from: (filled at commit time)
Quality gates: 141 frontend tests, 75 Rust tests, clippy, rustfmt, ESLint,
Prettier, strict typecheck, CI on Windows and macOS.

Bullet points for the GitHub release description:

- Bilingual by design: full English and Arabic interfaces with proper RTL
  support, switchable instantly
- Browse the latest arXiv papers in six fields (AI, ML, NLP, CV, neural
  evolution, stats), search arXiv, and step back through any past day with
  real paper counts
- The day picker always reaches the current day: today's papers are
  selectable the moment they appear (previously the newest day lagged one
  day behind)
- Arabic mode: paper titles, dates and English terms inside AI answers
  keep their correct direction, no more flipped text
- Semantic Scholar as a second source: search with citation counts, TLDRs
  and venues, with an automatic honest fallback to arXiv when the free
  rate limit is busy; a friendly translated hint guides you when a search
  term is needed
- Read mode: built-in PDF reader with find-in-page, a draggable split
  between the paper and the explanation panel, and a section-by-section
  walkthrough
- AI explanations powered by your own providers: OpenAI-compatible
  (OpenAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq, Ollama, OpenCode Go, or any custom
  endpoint), with preset URLs locked and providers named by their model
- Ask questions about the paper in a chat panel with history; equations
  in answers render as real math (KaTeX)
- Resilient AI streams: long explanations survive provider resets and
  gateway timeouts (partial answers are kept, streaming timeout is 10
  minutes)
- Three themes: light, sepia and dark
- Save favorites and export your data to a timestamped JSON file
- Privacy first: API keys live only in the OS keychain (Windows
  Credential Manager / macOS Keychain), never in files or logs
- The Settings page shows the app version (1.0.2)
- Installers for Windows: MSI and NSIS setup

Status: superseded before publishing. Per the version-pump
rule (every user-facing change bumps the version), its fixes rolled
into v1.0.2. Kept here as a tracking log entry.

- Three themes: light, sepia and dark
- Save favorites and export your data to a timestamped JSON file
- Semantic Scholar is search-only: switching to it without a search term now shows a clear hint in your language, and the search box switches to "Search Semantic Scholar…"
- The day picker now includes today: the newest day is always the current day (previously it lagged one day behind)
- Arabic mode: English paper titles and terms inside AI answers keep their correct direction, no more flipped text
- The PDF reader's AI stream no longer fails with "error decoding response body" when a provider resets a long stream: partial answers are kept, and the streaming timeout was raised to 10 minutes
- The Settings page shows the app version (1.0.1)
- Privacy first: API keys live only in the OS keychain (Windows
  Credential Manager / macOS Keychain), never in files or logs

## Release checklist (for AI agents)

1. Run all gates: pnpm run test, pnpm run typecheck, pnpm run lint,
   pnpm run format:check, cargo test --lib, cargo clippy -- -D warnings,
   cargo fmt -- --check
2. Bump the version if needed in package.json, src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
   and src-tauri/Cargo.toml (keep all three in sync)
3. Build: node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build, then
   pnpm exec tauri build
4. Verify the binaries are newer than the sources:
   ls -la src-tauri/target/release/papyrus.exe src-tauri/src/papers.rs
5. Update this file and the README changelog with the same information
6. Commit, push, tag (git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z)
7. On GitHub: Releases -> Create new release -> pick the tag -> paste the
   bullet points -> attach the MSI and NSIS exe from
   src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
